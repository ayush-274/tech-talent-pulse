Full Stack Product Engineer,Jiga,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/jiga-full-stack-product-engineer,"Sun, 04 Jan 2026 08:06:09 +0000","Headquarters: Anywhere URL: http://https:/jiga.io/about-us What we're building Jiga is on a mission to help engineers build physical products faster. Think npm install for mechanical engineers - we're building the infrastructure that makes hardware development as fast as software. How we actually work We’re a small remote team made up of the best of the best. Our team members are distributed around the globe. While most of our product and engineering talent is located in Europe and Israel, you’ll also work with people from the US and Asia. Most of our work is made async, which is the secret sauce of our success. High trust, low bullshit: We don't count hours or peek over your shoulder on Slack. We trust you to get your work done and tell us when something's wrong. You'll have real ownership over what you build: which means you'll make a lot of decisions about architecture and functionality without endless approval cycles. (If that sounds terrifying, we're probably not a good fit. If that sounds exciting, keep reading.) Question everything: See something that doesn't make sense? Say it. Have a better way to do something? Just do it. We actually mean it when we say we want people to challenge the status quo and improve things. Our internal motto is “Don’t drink the kool-aid” No stupid Meetings: One weekly all-hands. One dev team sync. That's literally it. Everything else happens async in Slack or Loom. Your calendar will be beautifully, gloriously empty. Actually friendly, not corporate friendly: We play games online every week (current favorite: Make it Meme). Once a year we fly everyone somewhere beautiful for our offsite (Greece, here we come). We genuinely like hanging out together, which turns out to be way better than forced ""team building exercises."" What we value in engineering: Simple > Complicated. Simple code, simple architecture; Simple solutions are better than complex ones. Ship it, then improve it. Perfection is the enemy of done. Launch now, iterate forever. Product > Engineering. Every line of code should make our users' lives better. We're not here to show off our algorithmic prowess - we're here to solve real business problems. Financials Jiga is fully funded, cashflow positive, with growing revenue MoM. We're completely transparent about our runway and finances - ask us anything. You'll love it here if You want to actually own things. Not ""ownership"" where you need three approvals to change a button color. Real ownership where you decide what to build, how to build it, and when to ship it. You're genuinely full-stack - you're equally happy building a slick UI component or optimizing a database query. There's no task you'd refuse because it's ""not your specialty."" You care about the product, not just the code . You want to understand why we're building something and you'll push back if it doesn't make sense. You are motivated to run a marathon and ring the bell with us in 3-4 years from now. Bureaucracy makes you want to scream . Multiple approval layers, process for the sake of process, corporate theatre - if these sound like your nightmare, welcome home. You love shipping. Like, you get genuinely excited when you push to production. That ""it's alive!"" feeling never gets old. You work fast because you're having fun, not because someone's watching you. This might not be for you if You hate ambiguity. You prefer clear, detailed task assignments and well-defined requirements You like having management to check in, review and verify your work multiple times until it’s perfect You're looking for a cuddly, 9-5, corporate job where you can coast a bit You like the smell of gasoline and motor oil while driving to the office every day (sorry, we are 100% remote) You like weeks of architecting over-complicated solutions (No judgment if that's what you want - it's just not what we are.) What you need 3+ years building full-stack web applications end-to-end Strong at React + Node.js. MongoDB experience is a great plus. Experience building complex applications - you understand clean architecture, security, scaling, performance, and maintainability Solid data modeling fundamentals Product company experience (you've felt the joy and pain of real users) Some overlap with GMT+3 working hours so we can actually talk to you sometimes What we offer No ping pong tables. No beer kegs. No ""unlimited vacation"" that nobody takes. No ice cream fridge at the office. Oh right, we don't even have an office. Here's what we do have: A small team where you matter - we never compromise on people, that means you are part of the best team in the world. Zero bureaucracy - we hate process theatre as much as you do Real ownership and responsibility - make decisions, ship code, own the outcomes. Have real impact on the product from day 1. Complete flexibility - work from anywhere, set your own hours, take time off when you need it (parents and DMs are very welcome) Genuinely high trust - we trust you to do great work and be honest when things go sideways A team that actually likes each other - international, diverse, genuinely friendly people who enjoy working together Generous stock options - we’re looking for partners to run a marathon with us, you will get a life-changing shares when we get to the finish line Competitive salary and PTOs - so you can also enjoy, relax and recharge Self-development budget for books, courses, conferences, whatever helps you grow Annual offsite in beautiful places (greece, here we come!) Fast-paced environment with tons of creative freedom Hard, interesting problems with a team that's positioned to win big To apply: https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/jiga-full-stack-product-engineer",2026-01-13

Senior Rails developer,WodBoard,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/wodboard-senior-rails-developer-1,"Fri, 02 Jan 2026 13:58:52 +0000","Headquarters: London URL: https://www.wodboard.com We're looking for a senior rails developer to come work with us at WodBoard WodBoard is gym management software that helps gym owners run their businesses and helps their customers, the gym members, live healthier lives.  The brand name won't make any sense unless you've walked into a functional fitness gym before so I'll move swiftly on... We're a bootstrapped company so there's no VCs to answer to.  That doesn't mean we're not ambitious though - there's a massive market we're going after and we want to create lasting change.  As a combination of these two things we've a heavy focus on getting stuff done. Our development ethos could be best described as ""full DHH"". Whilst there's some bits we don't 100% agree with we stick to the core Rails ethos and stack, focussing on what we can achieve with the technology, rather than the technology itself.  If you've enjoyed some of the blog posts on how Basecamp structure code, or enjoy the work of boringrails.com, you'd like working with us. We're a small (but mighty) tech team of 4 so you'll be jumping straight in and writing code for customers from day 1. There's also infrastructure/UI work/mobile app development work that happens and you can become involved in if you so wish.  The role has the opportunity to build into a CTO role for the right person. A little more about the role and us: It's really refreshing using technology to do something that helps people in a real world tangible way.  Changing lives and increasing health through technology is very motivating! We love simplicity.  We're fanatical about it.  This goes from our codebase, to our infrastructure, to how we operate as a company.  It can be harder work upfront but it sure makes life easier down the road. You'll need strong ownership skills.  As a small team we don't have project managers.  You're responsible for your tasks so you'll need to be good at taking ownership and reporting back to the team. An ability to renegotiate requirements as you get into the technical details is most welcome!  In Computer Science there's hard problems and hard problems that don't need solving.  We are constantly asking ourselves if there's an easier way to do something. We spend a lot of time talking to our customers and understanding their problems.  This won't ever change.  Be prepared to go back and evaluate previously held assumptions on new features after testing with beta customers The position is fulltime and by no means do you need to be into health/fitness to work here (only about 50% of our staff are).  It's fully remote position but you'd need to be on an EU timezone so there's sufficient overlap with the rest of the team.  We also do a full team meetup in person twice per year.

AI Product Engineer,PostHog,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/posthog-ai-product-engineer,"Wed, 26 Nov 2025 00:02:22 +0000","Headquarters: San Francisco URL: https://posthog.com/ About PostHog We're shipping every product that companies need to run their business from their first day, to the day they IPO, and beyond. The operating system for folks who build software. We started with open-source product analytics, launched out of Y Combinator's W20 cohort. We've since shipped more than a dozen products including: A built-in data warehouse , so users can query product and customer data together using custom SQL insights. A customer data platform , so they can send their data wherever they need with ease. PostHog AI , an AI-powered analyst that answers product questions, helps users find useful session recordings, and writes custom SQL queries. Next on the roadmap are CRM, messaging, revenue analytics, and support products. When we say every product that companies need to run their business, we really mean it! We are: 1. Product-led . More than 100,000 companies have installed PostHog, mostly driven by word-of-mouth. We have intensely strong product-market fit. 2. Default alive . Revenue is growing 10% MoM on average, and we're very efficient. We raise money to push ambition and grow faster, not to keep the lights on. 3. Well-funded . We've raised more than $100m from some of the world's top investors . We're set up for a long, ambitious journey. We're focused on building an awesome product for end users, hiring exceptional teammates, shipping fast, and being as weird as possible . Things we care about Transparency : Everyone can read about our roadmap, how we pay (or even let go of) people, our strategy, and how we work, in our public company handbook . Internally, we share revenue, notes and slides from board meetings, and fundraising plans, so everyone has the context they need to make good decisions. Autonomy : We don’t tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses what to work on next based on what's going to have the biggest impact on our customers, and what they find interesting and motivating to work on. Engineers lead product teams and make product decisions . Teams are flexible and easy to change when needed. Shipping fast : Why not now? We want to build a lot of products; we can't do that shipping at a normal pace. We've built the company around small teams – autonomous, highly-efficient groups of cracked engineers who can outship much larger companies because they own their products end-to-end. Time for building : Nothing gets shipped in a meeting. We're a natively remote company. We default to async communication – PRs > Issues > Slack. Tuesdays and Thursdays are meeting-free days , and we prioritize heads down building time over perfect coordination. This will be the most productive job you've ever had. Ambition : We want to solve big problems. We strongly believe that aiming for the best possible upside, and sometimes missing, is better than never trying. We're optimistic about what's possible and our ability to get there. Being weird : Weird means redesigning an already world-class website for the 5th time. It means shipping literally every product that relates to customer data. It means building an objectively unnecessary developer toy with dubious shareholder value. Doing weird stuff is a competitive advantage. And it's fun. Who we're looking for We’re looking for a full-stack engineer who knows how to leverage LLMs to make PostHog 10x more powerful. You’ve built and shipped agentic AI applications before and understand it’s more than just hitting an API with a good prompt. You’ll fit right in if you: Ship end-to-end AI apps — from backend infra to frontend UX. Collaborate widely — work across teams, find the right people, and make progress fast. Think like a product builder — care about users and outcomes, not just code. If you’ve worked in autonomous agents, workflow automation, or AI copilots before, you’ll feel at home — but here you’ll get to build it from scratch, in the open, with massive impact. What makes this role unique In this role, you’re not hacking together an AI agent hoping someone will use it — you’re building on top of a firehose of real customer data with immediate impact, whether that means creating new AI-powered tools or building observability features that help others understand how their agents perform in the wild. Impact from day one: You’re building agents on top of real customer data — not toy demos, not “when we get users.” Data advantage: PostHog already collects all the context agents need to be useful: analytics, sessions, events, feature flags, and more. You’ll build on top of it all. Agents that matter: Instead of copilots on the side, you’ll create background agents embedded into engineering workflows - changing how software gets built. Or, you might focus on building the analytics and observability layer around those agents - surfacing insights, clustering behaviors, and measuring model quality so teams can improve their own AI systems with confidence. Build in the open: Work with feedback from the largest open-source product engineering communities in the world. What you'll be doing Owning products and features from beginning to end. This means originating ideas based on your intuition, talking to users, and understanding our strategy and goals. It means testing MVPs in production with real users. It means iterating on their feedback , owning pricing, and ensuring the ongoing success of your work. Collaborating with design (when necessary). Product engineers at PostHog are full-stack, so we expect you to ship and own the basic UX of your work using our design system . From there, it's up to you to decide when to collaborate with our design team to iterate and polish the experience. Implementing AI features . LLMs, eh? They're getting prettaaay, prettaay good . All our products integrate with PostHog AI, so you'll likely be working with the PostHog AI team to implement AI features in your products. For some teams, that means designing observability and evaluation features for AI products. Talking to users . Good product engineers read feedback from users and iterate quickly. Great product engineers have users they're friendly with, talk with them frequently, bounce ideas off them, and iterate with them when they ship new things. Doing support. Every week, one person in each engineering team is designated the Support hero. Their job is to investigate and resolve issues reported by customers for their product.

Experienced Ruby Product Engineer,Silverfin,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/silverfin-experienced-ruby-product-engineer-1,"Tue, 23 Dec 2025 08:30:21 +0000","Headquarters: Gent, Belgium URL: https://silverfin.com/ We start with the cliff notes about the position. If this appeals to you, continue reading for a longer text about working at Silverfin and your role At Silverfin, we're an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. Although we know we’re not perfect yet, we are working hard on it and always open for your feedback. According to our vision to build a diverse, equitable and inclusive organisation, our policy is to only make a final hiring decision if underrepresented groups are sufficiently represented in the list of candidates applying for the position. For this reason it’s possible interviews get slightly delayed until we’ve reached that goal. We're committed to elevating talent by creating an environment where we can all thrive together. So if you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily check every single box, please consider applying. We'd love to hear how you might contribute to our mission and our team.

Please note: Most candidates start at the lower to mid part of the range, depending on experience and how their profile compares to our existing team. The higher end of the range is typically offered to individuals with a track record of strong impact and deep expertise in similar roles. We run annual compensation reviews, so there is clear opportunity for growth as you progress in the role. What will you work on? Figure out the best way to solve a customer or business problem in close collaboration with a product manager, a product designer and other engineers Work on user facing functionalities Help with discovery and delivery of a solution Give the engineering perspective on potential ways of approaching a specific challenge Help with maintenance and support of existing functionality What are we looking for? You’re experienced in both Ruby and Rails, and also understand where the boundaries lie between them. You can code in Ruby without any of Rails’ training wheels if necessary. You have experience using Javascript framework(s), understand the value of them, but also know when plain Javascript is enough. You're interested in getting to know our customers to find the best solution for a given challenge. You can communicate clearly in English, both in writing and verbally. You’re up for mentoring coworkers and can give in-depth, productive feedback during code reviews. While you appreciate the small stuff, you recognise bike-shedding and can avoid its pitfalls. You know and can apply best practices when relevant. That means the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but also higher level concepts such as good object oriented design. You're aware of the trade-offs involved in proper engineering and can make balanced business decisions, keeping in mind all the stakeholders of the project. You’ve got opinions on code design and you can discuss them, but you’re professional enough to not let those opinions get in the way of a consensus if necessary. If you’re any good at Ruby, this is probably not the first job ad you’ve seen, so we’ve done our best to stand out while also accurately presenting what we’re all about. If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us, don’t hesitate to apply or drop us a line with questions , or read on for the more detailed explanation .. What’s a Silverfin? At Silverfin we’re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we’re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimise their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners. The good news is we’re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every week more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 400.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there’s still plenty left to work on, and that’s where we hope you come in. Since November 2023 we are proudly part of Visma - the European leader in mission-critical cloud software, enjoying the power of the Visma brand and resources whilst retaining business autonomy and go-to-market freedom. What’s the product team like? The product team is a cross-functional team where engineers work together closely with product managers and product designers. The team's input is a user or business problem which it can solve with a high degree of autonomy. From day one all profiles are involved in understanding the problem, ideating solutions and doing quick experiments to prove that a certain solution might actually lead to the desired outcome. After the discovery phase the same team is tasked with the delivery of the chosen solution. The team will then track the adoption of the solution and will make sure that the problem is actually solved. The setup of the team is largely based on the book ""Inspired"" by Marty Cagan. What does working at Silverfin look like? Next to the four product teams, there are three more platformy teams, who own complex subsystems, like syncs or AI, and or support the product teams with knowledge, frameworks and services. Our ops team ensures things run smoothly, deploys happen correctly, and will work with you when issues should arise. We’re enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset, which means ops and developers work together to solve problems, and empower each-other to be self-sufficient, instead of throwing problems over the wall to the “other side”. We run an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend, with PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching, and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. Our daily tools include GitLab, Quip and Slack, with Google Meet as our remote conferencing tool of choice. No code gets deployed without a code-review by a peer and testing is a must. Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green, and deploys happen dozens of times a day. Each team is currently doing Kanban, but they’re free to follow whatever process suits them best. There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvement. Software for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 10TB*, and our largest table has crossed the 10 billion row mark a long while back. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own. *: Our ops team noted that this actually isn’t that hard to achieve if you’re just indexing everything, but it still sounds impressive, right? What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special? We’re a remote-first engineering team of 40 people distributed in 14 different countries over two continents. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they’ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring, and we feel that’s exactly how it should be. Working with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It’s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids - whatever reason, you don’t need to explain yourself. You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organised that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases it’s not, we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday. Being remote-first means we favour asynchronous communication. We don’t shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in Quip, so there’s a written, persisted record. We’re mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slack’s DnD function, especially when you’re not working! We’d be really happy to welcome you in our #engineering channel, but it’s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments. What does your future look like? Personal growth is key to staying motivated. At Silverfin you don’t need to move to management in order to advance. We see the individual contributor track and the management track as two different growth paths which every engineer can follow and switch between. You can be promoted, including pay raises, as a contributor just like as a manager. Everyone has a €1200 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes accommodation, travel costs. If the conference is on a workday you’ll get paid like any normal day. Requirements You have at least 4 years of experience working with Ruby, or 2 years of experience with Ruby and 4 years in one or more other programming languages You have experience Javascript framework(s) Your work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h) You can communicate clearly in English, both written and verbally Nice to haves These would be nice but are definitely not necessary. Don’t worry if none of the following applies to you. Experience as a remote worker in a fully remote team Experience working with large datasets and the problems they bring Experience with Vue.js Experience in Fintech Accounting knowledge Interested? You can apply today and we’ll start having interviews from 24/11/2025. There’s no benefit to applying early, so you can take your time answering the application questions.

Remote - Full time Must be physically located in the USA Must be authorized to work in the USA with no sponsorship required About Us DynamiCare Health is a digital therapeutics startup that helps people overcome addiction. In 8 peer-reviewed publications, DynamiCare increased quit rates for opioids, stimulants, alcohol, and tobacco by 2-4x compared to typical treatment. DynamiCare has won FDA Breakthrough Status and is already breaking into U.S. healthcare system reimbursement with partners that include the State of Rhode Island, Allegheny County of Pennsylvania, BCBS of Massachusetts, Horizon BCBSNJ, Spring Health, and Cityblock Health. We understand that recovery isn't one-size-fits-all, which is why our platform provides the flexibility and continuous support needed for sustainable behavior change. We're transforming addiction care and helping more people reclaim their lives from substance use disorders. Through the Digital Recovery Platform, DynamiCare is bringing proven therapeutic approaches into the digital age, making recovery support available whenever and wherever our members need it most. About the job Working as a Full-Stack Engineer at DynamiCare, you'll join a fully remote Agile team to design, build, and maintain secure, evidence-based applications. Since we're a small business, you'll have the opportunity to wear many different hats related to DevOps, Security, and other engineering-related fields. As the primary developer at DynamiCare, you'll have ownership over the codebase, making this a huge opportunity for impact. There will also be room for growth in terms of leadership as the team expands, with potential to shape practices, mentor future developers, and take on greater responsibility in technical decision-making.

Refactor Rails models to enhance feature development and data processing efficiency. Improve our appointment tracking features to include recurring appointments. Maintaining a probability engine used to schedule substance tests, ensuring functionality by writing a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests. Building new serializers in Rails to help export data in XLSX or CSV format so that our team has insights on key metrics.

We’re also looking for someone familiar with Agile development, particularly Scrum and sprint-based workflows. Proficiency with collaboration and project management tools like Asana, Confluence, and Jira is important for staying aligned with the team. Even though you’re experienced, we don’t expect you to hit the ground running on day one.

Strong communication is essential here, whether you're debugging code, collaborating with designers, or explaining technical concepts to non-technical teammates. We also foster a collaborative environment where every voice is heard, and respectful dialogue and constructive feedback are encouraged. Our shared goal is to build a product that helps people recover from addiction, and we believe that happens best when everyone works together with openness and clarity. A Computer Science degree or equivalent is not required for this position. If you have the chops and the skills needed to do the job well, that’s all that matters. While you’ll report to our Director of IT & Engineering, we strongly believe in autonomy here at DynamiCare. It’s vital that you know how to manage your time, and we trust that you will as well. Investing the time and effort here will help advance your career and expose you to new and exciting challenges. This position is remote and operates on Eastern Time. You’re free to work wherever you succeed the most: whether it be at home or in a coffee shop. We are hiring from anywhere in the United States.
