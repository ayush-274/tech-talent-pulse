If you are looking for career-defining challenges and an environment that fosters personal growth and high agency ownership over your work, you will feel right at home at Contra. We care just as much about character — being positive, low-ego, and collaborative — as we do technical excellence. Your skillset is only half of the equation.

If questions like “How do you interpret a flamegraph?” or “How do you read an EXPLAIN ANALYZE output?” leave you puzzled, this isn’t the right role. You thrive on steep learning curves. Our systems are large and complex — it can feel like a lot at first. People who are high-agency , proactive in communication , and have a strong sense of team play tend to thrive here. If you prefer highly structured environments or need constant direction, you probably won’t enjoy it. You take ownership.
