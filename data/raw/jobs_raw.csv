Product Engineer - Data Modeling,PostHog,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/posthog-product-engineer-data-modeling,"Wed, 26 Nov 2025 00:14:40 +0000","Headquarters: San Francisco URL: https://posthog.com/ About PostHog We equip every developer to build successful products . We started with open-source product analytics, launched out of Y Combinator's W20 cohort . We've since shipped more than a dozen products , including a built-in data warehouse , a customer data platform , and Max AI , an AI-powered analyst that answers product questions, helps users find useful session recordings, and writes custom SQL queries. Next on the roadmap are messaging, customer analytics, ai task creation and coding based on customer data, logs and support analytics. Our values are not a poster on the wall full of aspiration. They’ve come from how we really work, day in day out. PostHog is open source product led, and a default alive company that is well funded. What you'll be doing As a Product Engineer - Data Modeling s on the Data Stack team, you’ll build end user tools for understanding and traversing their data models. You’ll work on materializing user defined queries, and schedule & resolve DAGs of query materialization. You’ll debug stateful data workflows by digging into k8s pod metrics, and schedule jobs using Temporal.io . As you can see, there’s a huge breadth of challenges and opportunities to tackle, and nothing is off-limits. The PostHog Data Stack is both a core product for our users and a foundational platform for our internal teams. Data is a first-class product at PostHog, not an afterthought. You will have the chance to push the boundaries of what our Data Stack team can do while ensuring we remain stable and production-ready. You now know what you’ll be doing, but what about what you’ll need to bring along? You’ll fit right in if: You’re a builder. You bring strong skills in building resilient systems, with experience in Kubernetes, Docker, and S3 at scale. We build in python. Async-python and Temporal.io skills are welcome. You have good practices around building resilient systems. Logging, testing and monitoring (observability), but you are also comfortable with debugging stateful, async data workflows by digging into k8s pod metrics. You are proficient in building UIs for data intensive tools. React is part of your toolset. You bring experience with DAG’s and Batch processing. Having used Dbt is a plus. You bring a mix of skills. It’s not just about the query engine. You’ll need strong backend skills as we run a complex system. You love getting things done.

AI Product Engineer,PostHog,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/posthog-ai-product-engineer,"Wed, 26 Nov 2025 00:02:22 +0000","Headquarters: San Francisco URL: https://posthog.com/ About PostHog We're shipping every product that companies need to run their business from their first day, to the day they IPO, and beyond. The operating system for folks who build software. We started with open-source product analytics, launched out of Y Combinator's W20 cohort. We've since shipped more than a dozen products including: A built-in data warehouse , so users can query product and customer data together using custom SQL insights. A customer data platform , so they can send their data wherever they need with ease. PostHog AI , an AI-powered analyst that answers product questions, helps users find useful session recordings, and writes custom SQL queries. Next on the roadmap are CRM, messaging, revenue analytics, and support products. When we say every product that companies need to run their business, we really mean it! We are: 1. Product-led . More than 100,000 companies have installed PostHog, mostly driven by word-of-mouth. We have intensely strong product-market fit. 2. Default alive . Revenue is growing 10% MoM on average, and we're very efficient. We raise money to push ambition and grow faster, not to keep the lights on. 3. Well-funded . We've raised more than $100m from some of the world's top investors . We're set up for a long, ambitious journey. We're focused on building an awesome product for end users, hiring exceptional teammates, shipping fast, and being as weird as possible . Things we care about Transparency : Everyone can read about our roadmap, how we pay (or even let go of) people, our strategy, and how we work, in our public company handbook . Internally, we share revenue, notes and slides from board meetings, and fundraising plans, so everyone has the context they need to make good decisions. Autonomy : We don’t tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses what to work on next based on what's going to have the biggest impact on our customers, and what they find interesting and motivating to work on. Engineers lead product teams and make product decisions . Teams are flexible and easy to change when needed. Shipping fast : Why not now? We want to build a lot of products; we can't do that shipping at a normal pace. We've built the company around small teams – autonomous, highly-efficient groups of cracked engineers who can outship much larger companies because they own their products end-to-end. Time for building : Nothing gets shipped in a meeting. We're a natively remote company. We default to async communication – PRs > Issues > Slack. Tuesdays and Thursdays are meeting-free days , and we prioritize heads down building time over perfect coordination. This will be the most productive job you've ever had. Ambition : We want to solve big problems. We strongly believe that aiming for the best possible upside, and sometimes missing, is better than never trying. We're optimistic about what's possible and our ability to get there. Being weird : Weird means redesigning an already world-class website for the 5th time. It means shipping literally every product that relates to customer data. It means building an objectively unnecessary developer toy with dubious shareholder value. Doing weird stuff is a competitive advantage. And it's fun. Who we're looking for We’re looking for a full-stack engineer who knows how to leverage LLMs to make PostHog 10x more powerful. You’ve built and shipped agentic AI applications before and understand it’s more than just hitting an API with a good prompt. You’ll fit right in if you: Ship end-to-end AI apps — from backend infra to frontend UX. Collaborate widely — work across teams, find the right people, and make progress fast. Think like a product builder — care about users and outcomes, not just code. If you’ve worked in autonomous agents, workflow automation, or AI copilots before, you’ll feel at home — but here you’ll get to build it from scratch, in the open, with massive impact. What makes this role unique In this role, you’re not hacking together an AI agent hoping someone will use it — you’re building on top of a firehose of real customer data with immediate impact, whether that means creating new AI-powered tools or building observability features that help others understand how their agents perform in the wild. Impact from day one: You’re building agents on top of real customer data — not toy demos, not “when we get users.” Data advantage: PostHog already collects all the context agents need to be useful: analytics, sessions, events, feature flags, and more. You’ll build on top of it all. Agents that matter: Instead of copilots on the side, you’ll create background agents embedded into engineering workflows - changing how software gets built. Or, you might focus on building the analytics and observability layer around those agents - surfacing insights, clustering behaviors, and measuring model quality so teams can improve their own AI systems with confidence. Build in the open: Work with feedback from the largest open-source product engineering communities in the world. What you'll be doing Owning products and features from beginning to end. This means originating ideas based on your intuition, talking to users, and understanding our strategy and goals. It means testing MVPs in production with real users. It means iterating on their feedback , owning pricing, and ensuring the ongoing success of your work. Collaborating with design (when necessary). Product engineers at PostHog are full-stack, so we expect you to ship and own the basic UX of your work using our design system . From there, it's up to you to decide when to collaborate with our design team to iterate and polish the experience. Implementing AI features . LLMs, eh? They're getting prettaaay, prettaay good . All our products integrate with PostHog AI, so you'll likely be working with the PostHog AI team to implement AI features in your products. For some teams, that means designing observability and evaluation features for AI products. Talking to users . Good product engineers read feedback from users and iterate quickly. Great product engineers have users they're friendly with, talk with them frequently, bounce ideas off them, and iterate with them when they ship new things. Doing support. Every week, one person in each engineering team is designated the Support hero. Their job is to investigate and resolve issues reported by customers for their product. Giving users support from real engineers and shipping fixes and improvements in real-time is one of the best ways to spark joy in users. This role will also include some on-call time , too. Writing docs . We have a content team that will collaborate with you on reviewing, polishing, and improving your documentation, but the best person to document a new feature is the person who built it. Requirements Full-stack experience with relevant technologies – e.g. Python or similar, React or similar, something to do with big data is a bonus. Prior experience in AI workflow automation, copilots, or autonomous agent products. Ability to choose pragmatic architectures, ship quickly, and iterate based on real feedback. Strong sense for UX and product polish. Excellent communicator who thrives on collaboration across teams. Nice to have Have worked at a high-growth SaaS company before. Extensive knowledge of Django and/or TypeScript-based React. Experience building AI-native products or integrating AI into existing software. If you have a disability, please let us know if there's any way we can make the interview process better for you - we're happy to accommodate!

As a Senior Software Engineer , you’ll work alongside other engineers, designers, and product managers to tackle everything from huge company initiatives to modest but important bug fixes. While your primary focus will be frontend development, we value engineers who are T-shaped, bringing deep expertise in one area while being comfortable contributing in others. Whether that means leading the way on web and mobile, diving into backend code, or lending an extra set of eyes in discovery, you’ll collaborate with your teammates to move work forward. Most importantly, you’ll actively contribute to the evolution of the culture and processes of a growing engineering team, especially our client engineering discipline (this is what we call the frontend web and mobile disciplines collectively). We want devs with opinions on patterns, code organization, and processes to help make sure our codebases scale healthily, and an interest in mentoring to help make sure our devs do too. Working At CompanyCam Our engineering team is remote-first, spanning every time zone in the United States. We welcome people from all backgrounds and really don't care whether or not you have a CS degree or even a high school diploma. All that matters is that you're not an a**hole and you're good at what you do. At CompanyCam we’re driven to produce work with meaningful outcomes. That means not just dumping features and “improvements” but being able to reflect and learn from our outputs. We’re actively working to center our work on continuous discovery habits (CDH) as outlined by Teresa Torres. Our teams are made up of a product manager, a product designer, a tech lead and an appropriate number of engineers for the scope of your team. We take a flexible approach, pulling from Agile, Scrum, Kanban, and even Shape Up. Rather than being overly prescriptive, we provide guardrails and just enough constraints to keep teams moving. Each team is expected to collaborate, iterate, and refine their best practices to produce high-quality work. What You’ll Do Design, implement and deliver complex, cross-cutting features and systems in React and React Native, and occasionally in Ruby on Rails. Lead efforts to address technical debt and system reliability, proactively identifying areas for refactoring or optimization. Influence and evolve the architecture and system design, anticipating future needs and driving long-term improvements across services and applications. Set and uphold high standards for code quality, testing coverage, and documentation, mentoring others to do the same. Drive improvements to internal tooling to enhance developer experience and system resilience. Facilitate technical discussions and decision-making, helping the team navigate trade-offs and align on best solutions. Act as a point of escalation for complex technical challenges, supporting team members in unblocking progress. Partner closely with product managers, designers, and engineers, shaping feature direction by identifying technical opportunities, risks, and trade-offs early in discovery. What You’ll Bring Must-haves These are our non-negotiables: Show up : give us your best and have the courage to do difficult but necessary stuff. Grow up : be humble, take responsibility, learn continuously, and have a growth mindset. Do good : treat your co-workers and customers the way you want to be treated. 5+ years of experience working as a professional developer . (Not all years of experience are created equal, so this one isn't set in stone). Advanced proficiency in React and Redux , or an equivalent JS framework and state management library, with experience guiding architectural decisions and best practices for frontend systems. Experience with React Native or native iOS or Android. Experience contributing across the full stack, including front-end, back-end, and data layers. Demonstrated experience in leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to build, enhance, or optimize tools and features within products, driving innovation and improving user experience. Ability to handle complex tasks and ambiguous problems without guidance. Understanding of business trade-offs and ability to effectively communicate the risks and benefits of various technical approaches. Strong collaboration skills with the ability to lift up the team by providing mentorship and proactive feedback. You live and work permanently in the U.S. (We’re not set up to hire outside the U.S.). Nice-to-haves You’ll encounter the following technologies with varying frequency — experience with them is a plus, but not required: GraphQL & REST Apollo & TanStack Query Ruby on Rails Android Studio & Xcode Native mobile development (Java, Objective-C, Kotlin, Swift) Snowflake Experience integrating with large language models (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini) Benefits and Compensation This is a salaried position at CompanyCam. Our salary range is $175,000 - $200,000 per year and is based on experience. We also offer meaningful equity and other benefits . CompanyCam is an equal-opportunity employer committed to respect, inclusion, and growth. We work hard, take responsibility, and support each other. Great ideas come from all backgrounds, and we carefully consider every applicant without regard to personal characteristics or traits. Even if your work experience doesn’t align perfectly, we encourage you to apply. What really matters to us is your potential, your passion, and your commitment to learning, innovation, and contributing meaningfully to our team. For any accommodations or technical issues related to the online application or interview process, please email jobs@companycam.com and we’ll respond promptly.
