While the majority of your work will be performed during regular business hours, this role may occasionally require availability outside typical business hours. Please note: DynamiCare Health does not currently offer medical benefits. While we plan to make this a benefit soon, it is not available at this time. Remote - Full time Must be physically located in the USA Must be authorized to work in the USA with no sponsorship required About Us DynamiCare Health is a digital therapeutics startup that helps people overcome addiction. In 8 peer-reviewed publications, DynamiCare increased quit rates for opioids, stimulants, alcohol, and tobacco by 2-4x compared to typical treatment. DynamiCare has won FDA Breakthrough Status and is already breaking into U.S. healthcare system reimbursement with partners that include the State of Rhode Island, Allegheny County of Pennsylvania, BCBS of Massachusetts, Horizon BCBSNJ, Spring Health, and Cityblock Health. We understand that recovery isn't one-size-fits-all, which is why our platform provides the flexibility and continuous support needed for sustainable behavior change. We're transforming addiction care and helping more people reclaim their lives from substance use disorders. Through the Digital Recovery Platform, DynamiCare is bringing proven therapeutic approaches into the digital age, making recovery support available whenever and wherever our members need it most. About the job Working as a Full-Stack Engineer at DynamiCare, you'll join a fully remote Agile team to design, build, and maintain secure, evidence-based applications. Since we're a small business, you'll have the opportunity to wear many different hats related to DevOps, Security, and other engineering-related fields. As the primary developer at DynamiCare, you'll have ownership over the codebase, making this a huge opportunity for impact. There will also be room for growth in terms of leadership as the team expands, with potential to shape practices, mentor future developers, and take on greater responsibility in technical decision-making. We are currently striving to expand our user base and increase retention rates, with a Series A funding round on the horizon. We use a Ruby on Rails application, which powers multiple subdomains and includes a REST API that supports our member-facing React Native mobile app, as well as an Analytics application utilizing ActionView, React, and Stimulus. We believe DynamiCare is a great place to work. You'll collaborate in real time to make informed product decisions and play an active role in shaping the company's direction every day. We value your time and mental well-being, and we offer flexibility in working hours and time off. While there may be times when you need to jump in to resolve a critical bug, we strive to stay calm, focus on the root cause, and improve our workflows rather than place blame. Here are some examples of the work you might be doing at DynamiCare: Monitoring and responding to mobile and server package vulnerabilities, applying patches promptly, and evaluating whether they pose any risk to our users. Refactor Rails models to enhance feature development and data processing efficiency. Improve our appointment tracking features to include recurring appointments. Maintaining a probability engine used to schedule substance tests, ensuring functionality by writing a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests. Building new serializers in Rails to help export data in XLSX or CSV format so that our team has insights on key metrics. Creating and maintaining new background jobs to improve the scalability and performance of our application. Ensuring data security, privacy, and compliance with HIPAA. About you We’re seeking a candidate with a passion for technology and a motivation to make the world a better place. Your primary responsibilities will include full-stack development, DevOps, and maintaining strong data security across our platform. You should have at least three years of experience with our core frameworks: Ruby on Rails and React Native. Experience deploying and managing applications using CircleCI, Aptible, and AWS is especially valuable. Experience working within the confines of HIPAA and 42 CFR Part 2 is a strong plus, given the sensitive nature of our work. We’re also looking for someone familiar with Agile development, particularly Scrum and sprint-based workflows. Proficiency with collaboration and project management tools like Asana, Confluence, and Jira is important for staying aligned with the team. Even though you’re experienced, we don’t expect you to hit the ground running on day one. We value thoughtful onboarding and provide you with the time and support needed to learn our systems and processes. Strong communication is essential here, whether you're debugging code, collaborating with designers, or explaining technical concepts to non-technical teammates. We also foster a collaborative environment where every voice is heard, and respectful dialogue and constructive feedback are encouraged. Our shared goal is to build a product that helps people recover from addiction, and we believe that happens best when everyone works together with openness and clarity. A Computer Science degree or equivalent is not required for this position. If you have the chops and the skills needed to do the job well, that’s all that matters. While you’ll report to our Director of IT & Engineering, we strongly believe in autonomy here at DynamiCare. It’s vital that you know how to manage your time, and we trust that you will as well. Investing the time and effort here will help advance your career and expose you to new and exciting challenges. This position is remote and operates on Eastern Time. You’re free to work wherever you succeed the most: whether it be at home or in a coffee shop. We are hiring from anywhere in the United States. Tech Stack Mobile React Native using Expo SDK Integrations Server Ruby on Rails AWS S3 QuickSight Aptible PostgreSQL Data Security HIPAA Compliance DevOps GitHub CircleCI Docker Datadog Sentry How to apply Please submit your application with a resume, a GitHub link, and a cover letter that tells us who you are and what you can offer to DynamiCare, as well as our company’s role in your career and future. Interview Process We aim to make a hiring decision by August 31, 2025. All interviews will be conducted over Zoom. The process includes four stages: Initial Screening – A brief call to learn more about your background and interest in the role. Interview with Direct Manager – A deeper discussion about your experience and technical alignment with the team. Interview with CEO and Head of Product Design – Focused on company vision, product thinking, and cross-functional collaboration. Coding Challenge – A live technical exercise to evaluate your problem-solving skills and coding approach. We value your time and strive to keep the process efficient, respectful, and transparent. You can expect each interview stage to be scheduled approximately 24–48 hours apart during business days.

We’re currently hiring our first dedicated UI Engineer to “own” the frontend of our flagship product, Mobena Evolution, for which we have little to no frontend code. You’ll work directly with our backend/algorithm-focused CTO, as well as our designer-founder, to turn evolving Figma concepts into fast, maintainable, and scalable user interfaces. What You’ll Do Choose and justify the frameworks and tools that best fit our needs. We have some holdover prototype code in Vite JS, but you can take it or leave it; all of our Figma concepts are new. The backend is a standard HTTP API. We are open to everything from established web stacks (React, Angular, Svelte, Vite) to cross-platform or native solutions (Qt, WASM, .NET MAUI, Tauri, Electron, Tk)—literally anything, if you can convince us it’s the right choice. Build our UI from the ground up, establishing clear, maintainable patterns for components, state management, styling, testing, performance, and accessibility. Collaborate to refine and sometimes re-frame existing screen designs in Figma. Connect the frontend to our APIs (REST, GraphQL, or similar). Lay groundwork for future mobile clients; however, experience in this regard is a plus rather than a requirement. About You You’ve shipped an interactive application—web, desktop, or mobile—via coursework, open source, side project or professional work. You care about usability and design quality. (That is, you care about the user.) You learn by doing: building things rather than sitting in committee. You are happy to say I don’t know. We try to cultivate “beginner’s mind” at Mobena—it helps us avoid conventional traps and groupthink. The first step of thinking like a beginner is acknowledging your own ignorance! 😊 You can defend your technical choices in clear English, and can take credit for your successes as well your mistakes. You are comfortable in an early-stage, collaborative environment. To apply: https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/mobena-frontend-engineer",2026-01-04

Strong Morals: Since our founding, we've turned down somewhere between $1mm - $2mm of work that didn't meet our moral standards.

High-Volume Scraping: Manage enterprise-level scraping (1,000s of requests/second) and reverse-engineering of public data sources. Chrome Extension: Maintain and expand our extension that bridges our platform with customer accounts. Ship Fast: We use ChatGPT/Copilot heavily to speed up boilerplate code so we can focus on the complex logic. Frontend (Light): We use React/Tailwind.

Interview process - 30 min non technical call with myself. - 1 hour technical pair programming challenge (not leetcode but real-life problems) - Meet up in person with both founders - Offer Why This Role? Real Revenue: We aren't just an MVP, we have customers who have been with us for months earning more revenue with 0% churn. High Equity: 2% is a good chunk for our stage, it should be worth a significant amount within a years time as we raise at higher valuations. Hard Problems: If you get bored building standard CRUD apps, our scraping, MCP & automation challenges will keep you engaged.
