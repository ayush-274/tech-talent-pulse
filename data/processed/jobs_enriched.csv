You’ll also help us figure out exactly what work still needs to be done. Key Responsibilities: Turn detailed Figma designs into a responsive, accessible, and fully functional WordPress site Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code using CSS, PHP, JavaScript and HTML.

Think npm install for mechanical engineers - we're building the infrastructure that makes hardware development as fast as software. How we actually work We’re a small remote team made up of the best of the best. Our team members are distributed around the globe. While most of our product and engineering talent is located in Europe and Israel, you’ll also work with people from the US and Asia. Most of our work is made async, which is the secret sauce of our success. High trust, low bullshit: We don't count hours or peek over your shoulder on Slack. We trust you to get your work done and tell us when something's wrong. You'll have real ownership over what you build: which means you'll make a lot of decisions about architecture and functionality without endless approval cycles. (If that sounds terrifying, we're probably not a good fit. If that sounds exciting, keep reading.) Question everything: See something that doesn't make sense? Say it. Have a better way to do something? Just do it. We actually mean it when we say we want people to challenge the status quo and improve things. Our internal motto is “Don’t drink the kool-aid” No stupid Meetings: One weekly all-hands. One dev team sync. That's literally it. Everything else happens async in Slack or Loom. Your calendar will be beautifully, gloriously empty. Actually friendly, not corporate friendly: We play games online every week (current favorite: Make it Meme). Once a year we fly everyone somewhere beautiful for our offsite (Greece, here we come). We genuinely like hanging out together, which turns out to be way better than forced ""team building exercises."" What we value in engineering: Simple > Complicated. Simple code, simple architecture; Simple solutions are better than complex ones. Ship it, then improve it. Perfection is the enemy of done. Launch now, iterate forever. Product > Engineering. Every line of code should make our users' lives better. We're not here to show off our algorithmic prowess - we're here to solve real business problems. Financials Jiga is fully funded, cashflow positive, with growing revenue MoM. We're completely transparent about our runway and finances - ask us anything. You'll love it here if You want to actually own things. Not ""ownership"" where you need three approvals to change a button color. Real ownership where you decide what to build, how to build it, and when to ship it. You're genuinely full-stack - you're equally happy building a slick UI component or optimizing a database query. There's no task you'd refuse because it's ""not your specialty."" You care about the product, not just the code . You want to understand why we're building something and you'll push back if it doesn't make sense. You are motivated to run a marathon and ring the bell with us in 3-4 years from now. Bureaucracy makes you want to scream . Multiple approval layers, process for the sake of process, corporate theatre - if these sound like your nightmare, welcome home. You love shipping. Like, you get genuinely excited when you push to production. That ""it's alive!"" feeling never gets old. You work fast because you're having fun, not because someone's watching you. This might not be for you if You hate ambiguity. You prefer clear, detailed task assignments and well-defined requirements You like having management to check in, review and verify your work multiple times until it’s perfect You're looking for a cuddly, 9-5, corporate job where you can coast a bit You like the smell of gasoline and motor oil while driving to the office every day (sorry, we are 100% remote) You like weeks of architecting over-complicated solutions (No judgment if that's what you want - it's just not what we are.) What you need 3+ years building full-stack web applications end-to-end Strong at React + Node.js. MongoDB experience is a great plus. Experience building complex applications - you understand clean architecture, security, scaling, performance, and maintainability Solid data modeling fundamentals Product company experience (you've felt the joy and pain of real users) Some overlap with GMT+3 working hours so we can actually talk to you sometimes What we offer No ping pong tables. No beer kegs. No ""unlimited vacation"" that nobody takes. No ice cream fridge at the office. Oh right, we don't even have an office. Here's what we do have: A small team where you matter - we never compromise on people, that means you are part of the best team in the world. Zero bureaucracy - we hate process theatre as much as you do Real ownership and responsibility - make decisions, ship code, own the outcomes. Have real impact on the product from day 1. Complete flexibility - work from anywhere, set your own hours, take time off when you need it (parents and DMs are very welcome) Genuinely high trust - we trust you to do great work and be honest when things go sideways A team that actually likes each other - international, diverse, genuinely friendly people who enjoy working together Generous stock options - we’re looking for partners to run a marathon with us, you will get a life-changing shares when we get to the finish line Competitive salary and PTOs - so you can also enjoy, relax and recharge Self-development budget for books, courses, conferences, whatever helps you grow Annual offsite in beautiful places (greece, here we come!) Fast-paced environment with tons of creative freedom Hard, interesting problems with a team that's positioned to win big To apply: https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/jiga-full-stack-product-engineer",2026-01-28,"['react', 'mongodb', 'node.js']"

Senior Rails developer,WodBoard,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/wodboard-senior-rails-developer-1,"Fri, 02 Jan 2026 13:58:52 +0000","Headquarters: London URL: https://www.wodboard.com We're looking for a senior rails developer to come work with us at WodBoard WodBoard is gym management software that helps gym owners run their businesses and helps their customers, the gym members, live healthier lives.  The brand name won't make any sense unless you've walked into a functional fitness gym before so I'll move swiftly on... We're a bootstrapped company so there's no VCs to answer to.  That doesn't mean we're not ambitious though - there's a massive market we're going after and we want to create lasting change.  As a combination of these two things we've a heavy focus on getting stuff done. Our development ethos could be best described as ""full DHH"". Whilst there's some bits we don't 100% agree with we stick to the core Rails ethos and stack, focussing on what we can achieve with the technology, rather than the technology itself.  If you've enjoyed some of the blog posts on how Basecamp structure code, or enjoy the work of boringrails.com, you'd like working with us. We're a small (but mighty) tech team of 4 so you'll be jumping straight in and writing code for customers from day 1. There's also infrastructure/UI work/mobile app development work that happens and you can become involved in if you so wish.  The role has the opportunity to build into a CTO role for the right person. A little more about the role and us: It's really refreshing using technology to do something that helps people in a real world tangible way.  Changing lives and increasing health through technology is very motivating! We love simplicity.  We're fanatical about it.  This goes from our codebase, to our infrastructure, to how we operate as a company.  It can be harder work upfront but it sure makes life easier down the road. You'll need strong ownership skills.  As a small team we don't have project managers.  You're responsible for your tasks so you'll need to be good at taking ownership and reporting back to the team. An ability to renegotiate requirements as you get into the technical details is most welcome!  In Computer Science there's hard problems and hard problems that don't need solving.  We are constantly asking ourselves if there's an easier way to do something. We spend a lot of time talking to our customers and understanding their problems.  This won't ever change.  Be prepared to go back and evaluate previously held assumptions on new features after testing with beta customers The position is fulltime and by no means do you need to be into health/fitness to work here (only about 50% of our staff are).  It's fully remote position but you'd need to be on an EU timezone so there's sufficient overlap with the rest of the team.  We also do a full team meetup in person twice per year.
