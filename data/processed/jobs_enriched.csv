Experienced Ruby Product Engineer,Silverfin,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/silverfin-experienced-ruby-product-engineer-1,"Tue, 23 Dec 2025 08:30:21 +0000","Headquarters: Gent, Belgium URL: https://silverfin.com/ We start with the cliff notes about the position. If this appeals to you, continue reading for a longer text about working at Silverfin and your role At Silverfin, we're an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. Although we know we’re not perfect yet, we are working hard on it and always open for your feedback. According to our vision to build a diverse, equitable and inclusive organisation, our policy is to only make a final hiring decision if underrepresented groups are sufficiently represented in the list of candidates applying for the position. For this reason it’s possible interviews get slightly delayed until we’ve reached that goal. We're committed to elevating talent by creating an environment where we can all thrive together. So if you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily check every single box, please consider applying. We'd love to hear how you might contribute to our mission and our team. What can we offer you? Actual, proper work-life balance Flexible working hours and work 100% remotely Personal growth training and opportunities Join a distributed remote-first engineering team with 40+ colleagues in 14 different countries on two continents A refreshing work environment with professional, friendly and welcoming colleagues A €1200 yearly budget for conferences, courses, workshops or other expenses that will improve your skills Two engineering retreats per year, somewhere in Europe Ten company-wide Wellbeing Days per year for all employees (once a month, except in July and August) Compensation For this role, the compensation range is  €104.000 - €130.000 a year , which reflects the total compensation band for senior engineers at this level. Please note: Most candidates start at the lower to mid part of the range, depending on experience and how their profile compares to our existing team. The higher end of the range is typically offered to individuals with a track record of strong impact and deep expertise in similar roles. We run annual compensation reviews, so there is clear opportunity for growth as you progress in the role. What will you work on? Figure out the best way to solve a customer or business problem in close collaboration with a product manager, a product designer and other engineers Work on user facing functionalities Help with discovery and delivery of a solution Give the engineering perspective on potential ways of approaching a specific challenge Help with maintenance and support of existing functionality What are we looking for? You’re experienced in both Ruby and Rails, and also understand where the boundaries lie between them. You can code in Ruby without any of Rails’ training wheels if necessary. You have experience using Javascript framework(s), understand the value of them, but also know when plain Javascript is enough. You're interested in getting to know our customers to find the best solution for a given challenge. You can communicate clearly in English, both in writing and verbally. You’re up for mentoring coworkers and can give in-depth, productive feedback during code reviews. While you appreciate the small stuff, you recognise bike-shedding and can avoid its pitfalls. You know and can apply best practices when relevant. That means the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but also higher level concepts such as good object oriented design. You're aware of the trade-offs involved in proper engineering and can make balanced business decisions, keeping in mind all the stakeholders of the project. You’ve got opinions on code design and you can discuss them, but you’re professional enough to not let those opinions get in the way of a consensus if necessary. If you’re any good at Ruby, this is probably not the first job ad you’ve seen, so we’ve done our best to stand out while also accurately presenting what we’re all about. If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us, don’t hesitate to apply or drop us a line with questions , or read on for the more detailed explanation .. What’s a Silverfin? At Silverfin we’re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we’re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimise their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners. The good news is we’re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every week more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 400.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there’s still plenty left to work on, and that’s where we hope you come in. Since November 2023 we are proudly part of Visma - the European leader in mission-critical cloud software, enjoying the power of the Visma brand and resources whilst retaining business autonomy and go-to-market freedom. What’s the product team like? The product team is a cross-functional team where engineers work together closely with product managers and product designers. The team's input is a user or business problem which it can solve with a high degree of autonomy. From day one all profiles are involved in understanding the problem, ideating solutions and doing quick experiments to prove that a certain solution might actually lead to the desired outcome. After the discovery phase the same team is tasked with the delivery of the chosen solution. The team will then track the adoption of the solution and will make sure that the problem is actually solved. The setup of the team is largely based on the book ""Inspired"" by Marty Cagan. What does working at Silverfin look like? Next to the four product teams, there are three more platformy teams, who own complex subsystems, like syncs or AI, and or support the product teams with knowledge, frameworks and services. Our ops team ensures things run smoothly, deploys happen correctly, and will work with you when issues should arise. We’re enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset, which means ops and developers work together to solve problems, and empower each-other to be self-sufficient, instead of throwing problems over the wall to the “other side”. We run an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend, with PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching, and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. Our daily tools include GitLab, Quip and Slack, with Google Meet as our remote conferencing tool of choice. No code gets deployed without a code-review by a peer and testing is a must. Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green, and deploys happen dozens of times a day. Each team is currently doing Kanban, but they’re free to follow whatever process suits them best. There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvement. Software for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 10TB*, and our largest table has crossed the 10 billion row mark a long while back. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own. *: Our ops team noted that this actually isn’t that hard to achieve if you’re just indexing everything, but it still sounds impressive, right? What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special? We’re a remote-first engineering team of 40 people distributed in 14 different countries over two continents. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they’ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring, and we feel that’s exactly how it should be. Working with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It’s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids - whatever reason, you don’t need to explain yourself. You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organised that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases it’s not, we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday. Being remote-first means we favour asynchronous communication. We don’t shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in Quip, so there’s a written, persisted record. We’re mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slack’s DnD function, especially when you’re not working! We’d be really happy to welcome you in our #engineering channel, but it’s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments. What does your future look like? Personal growth is key to staying motivated. At Silverfin you don’t need to move to management in order to advance. We see the individual contributor track and the management track as two different growth paths which every engineer can follow and switch between. You can be promoted, including pay raises, as a contributor just like as a manager. Everyone has a €1200 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes accommodation, travel costs. If the conference is on a workday you’ll get paid like any normal day. Requirements You have at least 4 years of experience working with Ruby, or 2 years of experience with Ruby and 4 years in one or more other programming languages You have experience Javascript framework(s) Your work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h) You can communicate clearly in English, both written and verbally Nice to haves These would be nice but are definitely not necessary. Don’t worry if none of the following applies to you. Experience as a remote worker in a fully remote team Experience working with large datasets and the problems they bring Experience with Vue.js Experience in Fintech Accounting knowledge Interested? You can apply today and we’ll start having interviews from 24/11/2025. There’s no benefit to applying early, so you can take your time answering the application questions.

While the majority of your work will be performed during regular business hours, this role may occasionally require availability outside typical business hours. Please note: DynamiCare Health does not currently offer medical benefits. While we plan to make this a benefit soon, it is not available at this time. Remote - Full time Must be physically located in the USA Must be authorized to work in the USA with no sponsorship required About Us DynamiCare Health is a digital therapeutics startup that helps people overcome addiction. In 8 peer-reviewed publications, DynamiCare increased quit rates for opioids, stimulants, alcohol, and tobacco by 2-4x compared to typical treatment. DynamiCare has won FDA Breakthrough Status and is already breaking into U.S. healthcare system reimbursement with partners that include the State of Rhode Island, Allegheny County of Pennsylvania, BCBS of Massachusetts, Horizon BCBSNJ, Spring Health, and Cityblock Health. We understand that recovery isn't one-size-fits-all, which is why our platform provides the flexibility and continuous support needed for sustainable behavior change. We're transforming addiction care and helping more people reclaim their lives from substance use disorders. Through the Digital Recovery Platform, DynamiCare is bringing proven therapeutic approaches into the digital age, making recovery support available whenever and wherever our members need it most. About the job Working as a Full-Stack Engineer at DynamiCare, you'll join a fully remote Agile team to design, build, and maintain secure, evidence-based applications. Since we're a small business, you'll have the opportunity to wear many different hats related to DevOps, Security, and other engineering-related fields. As the primary developer at DynamiCare, you'll have ownership over the codebase, making this a huge opportunity for impact. There will also be room for growth in terms of leadership as the team expands, with potential to shape practices, mentor future developers, and take on greater responsibility in technical decision-making. We are currently striving to expand our user base and increase retention rates, with a Series A funding round on the horizon. We use a Ruby on Rails application, which powers multiple subdomains and includes a REST API that supports our member-facing React Native mobile app, as well as an Analytics application utilizing ActionView, React, and Stimulus. We believe DynamiCare is a great place to work. You'll collaborate in real time to make informed product decisions and play an active role in shaping the company's direction every day. We value your time and mental well-being, and we offer flexibility in working hours and time off. While there may be times when you need to jump in to resolve a critical bug, we strive to stay calm, focus on the root cause, and improve our workflows rather than place blame. Here are some examples of the work you might be doing at DynamiCare: Monitoring and responding to mobile and server package vulnerabilities, applying patches promptly, and evaluating whether they pose any risk to our users. Refactor Rails models to enhance feature development and data processing efficiency. Improve our appointment tracking features to include recurring appointments. Maintaining a probability engine used to schedule substance tests, ensuring functionality by writing a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests. Building new serializers in Rails to help export data in XLSX or CSV format so that our team has insights on key metrics. Creating and maintaining new background jobs to improve the scalability and performance of our application. Ensuring data security, privacy, and compliance with HIPAA. About you We’re seeking a candidate with a passion for technology and a motivation to make the world a better place. Your primary responsibilities will include full-stack development, DevOps, and maintaining strong data security across our platform. You should have at least three years of experience with our core frameworks: Ruby on Rails and React Native. Experience deploying and managing applications using CircleCI, Aptible, and AWS is especially valuable. Experience working within the confines of HIPAA and 42 CFR Part 2 is a strong plus, given the sensitive nature of our work. We’re also looking for someone familiar with Agile development, particularly Scrum and sprint-based workflows. Proficiency with collaboration and project management tools like Asana, Confluence, and Jira is important for staying aligned with the team. Even though you’re experienced, we don’t expect you to hit the ground running on day one. We value thoughtful onboarding and provide you with the time and support needed to learn our systems and processes. Strong communication is essential here, whether you're debugging code, collaborating with designers, or explaining technical concepts to non-technical teammates. We also foster a collaborative environment where every voice is heard, and respectful dialogue and constructive feedback are encouraged. Our shared goal is to build a product that helps people recover from addiction, and we believe that happens best when everyone works together with openness and clarity. A Computer Science degree or equivalent is not required for this position. If you have the chops and the skills needed to do the job well, that’s all that matters. While you’ll report to our Director of IT & Engineering, we strongly believe in autonomy here at DynamiCare. It’s vital that you know how to manage your time, and we trust that you will as well. Investing the time and effort here will help advance your career and expose you to new and exciting challenges. This position is remote and operates on Eastern Time. You’re free to work wherever you succeed the most: whether it be at home or in a coffee shop. We are hiring from anywhere in the United States. Tech Stack Mobile React Native using Expo SDK Integrations Server Ruby on Rails AWS S3 QuickSight Aptible PostgreSQL Data Security HIPAA Compliance DevOps GitHub CircleCI Docker Datadog Sentry How to apply Please submit your application with a resume, a GitHub link, and a cover letter that tells us who you are and what you can offer to DynamiCare, as well as our company’s role in your career and future. Interview Process We aim to make a hiring decision by August 31, 2025. All interviews will be conducted over Zoom. The process includes four stages: Initial Screening – A brief call to learn more about your background and interest in the role. Interview with Direct Manager – A deeper discussion about your experience and technical alignment with the team. Interview with CEO and Head of Product Design – Focused on company vision, product thinking, and cross-functional collaboration.

We’re currently hiring our first dedicated UI Engineer to “own” the frontend of our flagship product, Mobena Evolution, for which we have little to no frontend code. You’ll work directly with our backend/algorithm-focused CTO, as well as our designer-founder, to turn evolving Figma concepts into fast, maintainable, and scalable user interfaces. What You’ll Do Choose and justify the frameworks and tools that best fit our needs. We have some holdover prototype code in Vite JS, but you can take it or leave it; all of our Figma concepts are new. The backend is a standard HTTP API. We are open to everything from established web stacks (React, Angular, Svelte, Vite) to cross-platform or native solutions (Qt, WASM, .NET MAUI, Tauri, Electron, Tk)—literally anything, if you can convince us it’s the right choice. Build our UI from the ground up, establishing clear, maintainable patterns for components, state management, styling, testing, performance, and accessibility. Collaborate to refine and sometimes re-frame existing screen designs in Figma. Connect the frontend to our APIs (REST, GraphQL, or similar). Lay groundwork for future mobile clients; however, experience in this regard is a plus rather than a requirement. About You You’ve shipped an interactive application—web, desktop, or mobile—via coursework, open source, side project or professional work. You care about usability and design quality. (That is, you care about the user.) You learn by doing: building things rather than sitting in committee. You are happy to say I don’t know. We try to cultivate “beginner’s mind” at Mobena—it helps us avoid conventional traps and groupthink. The first step of thinking like a beginner is acknowledging your own ignorance! 😊 You can defend your technical choices in clear English, and can take credit for your successes as well your mistakes. You are comfortable in an early-stage, collaborative environment. To apply: https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/mobena-frontend-engineer",2026-01-08,"['react', 'angular']"

Strong Morals: Since our founding, we've turned down somewhere between $1mm - $2mm of work that didn't meet our moral standards.

You will be the technical lead, working directly with us to brainstorm ideas, architecture and ship code quickly. The Role This is a Backend-First role (70/30 split). You will spend most of your time in Python/Django, but you must be willing to jump into React/Tailwind to ship complete features ‍ We have interesting technical challenges involving high-volume data and browser automation (MCP/AI) Scale the Backend: Build and ship features using Python (Django) and Postgres. High-Volume Scraping: Manage enterprise-level scraping (1,000s of requests/second) and reverse-engineering of public data sources. Chrome Extension: Maintain and expand our extension that bridges our platform with customer accounts. Ship Fast: We use ChatGPT/Copilot heavily to speed up boilerplate code so we can focus on the complex logic. Frontend (Light): We use React/Tailwind. You don't need to be a frontend expert, but you should be willing to jump in and tweak UI when needed. The Logistics One founder is in Leeds, the other in London. We'd like to meet up occasionally to brainstorm & speed up onboarding as well in person. Salary: £70k - £90k (depending on experience). Equity: Up to 2% options (4-year vesting).

Interview process - 30 min non technical call with myself. - 1 hour technical pair programming challenge (not leetcode but real-life problems) - Meet up in person with both founders - Offer Why This Role? Real Revenue: We aren't just an MVP, we have customers who have been with us for months earning more revenue with 0% churn. High Equity: 2% is a good chunk for our stage, it should be worth a significant amount within a years time as we raise at higher valuations. Hard Problems: If you get bored building standard CRUD apps, our scraping, MCP & automation challenges will keep you engaged.

What you need: Experience building performant, scalable systems with Node.js, React, TypeScript, GraphQL, & PostgreSQL Excellence in independent problem-solving An eye for craft, polish, and attention-to-detail Obsession for responding quickly to user needs and delivering an excellent user experience Ability to thrive in fast-paced, remote environment with strong communication skills Ability to be energized by a highly-synchronous environment — we’re remote, but we’re not async. Our Engineering Team: We have a high bar for technical excellence at Contra, and that comes from one simple belief: a high density of capable and collaborative people creates maximum velocity, which is how we win. If you are looking for career-defining challenges and an environment that fosters personal growth and high agency ownership over your work, you will feel right at home at Contra. We care just as much about character — being positive, low-ego, and collaborative — as we do technical excellence. Your skillset is only half of the equation. We want teammates who elevate others, not just the codebase. We see Contra as a long-term journey, and we want to work and grow alongside other good, grounded folks who take pride in building great things together. Everyone on our team has an “untraditional background” in some way. We celebrate this!

We don’t want to waste your time. Here’s a quick self-check to see if you’re likely to make it through the interview process — and enjoy being part of the team: Technical depth: Can you comfortably answer low-level questions about Node.js, React, and PostgreSQL? These are core competencies we don’t compromise on. If questions like “How do you interpret a flamegraph?” or “How do you read an EXPLAIN ANALYZE output?” leave you puzzled, this isn’t the right role. You thrive on steep learning curves. Our systems are large and complex — it can feel like a lot at first. People who are high-agency , proactive in communication , and have a strong sense of team play tend to thrive here. If you prefer highly structured environments or need constant direction, you probably won’t enjoy it. You take ownership. When you hit a wall, your instinct is to debug, research, or ask the right person — not wait for someone to tell you what to do. We value momentum, curiosity, and bias toward action.
